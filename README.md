This project is something that will be developed for school class as it is required for passing the class.
I made it public for easy access to it and i might later change it to private if it will be required. Yet I suggest do not use its content. For it will not be of much value to you.

(if you found this repo, you are probably more skilled than me and I have to do it by myself so I cannot take on any direct advice so do not bother with me.)

If you want to learn from something that is in my project you are free to do so, but I cannot encourage it.
I cannot guarantee you that I am using best practices or doing something that is unefective but for functioning purposes it might be enough for me.

Winter Arc coding.. lets goo..
